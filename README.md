## Hi there 👋, I'm Ishita Singh!
I'm a master student, with a passion for motorsport engineering, machine learning, data science and mechatronics. I love information and am always curious about how things work in this world. I am very excited to land a new internship and continue my contribution to the world of tech, science and engineering!

### 💻 My Toolkit
Here are some of the technologies and tools I enjoy using:

Languages: Python, Julia, C/C++

Software: AutoCAD, CoppeliaSim, EAGLE, Github, KiCAD, LTspice, MATLAB, NI Multisim, Onshape, OpenRocket, Proteus, PTC Creo, TinkerCAD, Visual Studio Code

Areas of Interest: Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Embedded Systems, Control Systems, Microelectronics, Electric Vehicles, Battery Management Systems, VLSI, Storytelling

### What I'm currently working on
🔭 I’m currently working on a Data Science project about predicting the temperatures of a motor in an electric vehicle.

🌱 I’m currently learning about the FastF1 library, and implementing it in a Jupyter notebook which analyses race data from the dominating years of Sir Lewis Hamilton.

👯 I’m currently looking for a Thesis as the final stage of my master's degree!
